This directory includes new test instances for TSP-D. These instances are generated by following the rules in Agatz et al. (2018).

The folder name, for example `n11`, indicates the number of customer nodes plus the depot. Inside, there are files for 100 test instances:

#### `Concorde-TSP-len-100-n_nodes-11.txt`

Each row represents a test instance, where we follow the format of 
 
```
x1 y1 x2 y2 ... xn yn
```
    
where `x1 y1` are for the depot.

#### `RL-TSP-len-100-n_nodes-11.txt.txt`

Exactly the same instance as in `Concorde-TSP-len-100-n_nodes-11.txt`, but `xn yn` are for the depot.

#### `Agatz-heuristic-len-100-n_nodes-11.txt`
Solutions obtained by `TSP-ep-all` by Agatz et al. (2018).

#### `Agatz-heuristic-runtime-len-100-n_nodes-11.txt`

Runtime for `TSP-ep-all` by Agatz et al. (2018).
