This directory includes new test instances for TSP-D. 

The folder name, for example `n11`, indicates the number of customer nodes plus the depot. Inside, there are files for 100 test instances:

#### `TSPD-len-100-n_nodes-11.txt`

Each row represents a test instance, where we follow the format of 
 
```
x1 y1 x2 y2 ... xn yn
```
    
where `x1 y1` are for the depot.
